```setup {player_count} {pick_count} {format}

Sets up a draft with a specified player, pick count, and format.
    
    player_count - must be between 2 and 8 inclusively.
    pick_count - must be between 45 and 100 inclusively.
    format = must be one of the following: 

        - "brawl"
        - "commander"
        - "duel"
        - "freeform"
        - "future"
        - "gladiator"
        - "historic"
        - "legacy"
        - "modern"
        - "oldschool"
        - "pauper"
        - "penny"
        - "pioneer"
        - "premodern"
        - "standard"
        - "vintage"

        NOTE: freeform is not an actual format,
        but implies that any card in the history
        of magic is legal.

    example: !setup 4 45 modern
    - Creates a draft with 4 players, 45 picks per player,
    and the format is modern.```
